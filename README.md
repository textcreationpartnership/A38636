#An essay toward the clearer discovering of the true beginnings, durations and endings, of each particular king in Judah and Israel and the two lines thereof, compared and adjusted, according to the scriptures referring thereunto; and, in order to understanding of the reference of those 390, and 40 dayes, mention'd Ezekiel 4th. v.5,6. (Beginning after Solomon.) Upon enquiry thereinto, and examination thereof, I premise 2 or 3 things. (1.) That Rehoboams and Jereboams reigns must begin much together; else the 18th of Jeroboam's could not be the first of Abijahs, and his 20th the beginning of Asa's, Kings of Judah. (2.) That there's a dispute with some, whether Jehoram, Jehosaphat's son, and King of Judah, did reign 8 years or 4? some say the latter, (and 4 more only with his father. But to clear, that there must be 8 to him alone (or 4 more to his father and him, which amounts to the same number of years.) ... and so at last, to the remainder of the kings of Judah ending in Zedekiah; when the kings of Israel had ceased in Hoshea before.#
